# Gitting results
Github repository for "Gitting results" blog at [https://porteusconf.github.io/](https://porteusconf.github.io/)
Hopefully helpful posts of practical info for everyday computing, with intended audience of computer end-users (mac/win/linux) and IT folks. Hoping to use tone and style of "dummy" books, for the ["copleat idiot" in tribute to John Muir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Muir_(engineer))
