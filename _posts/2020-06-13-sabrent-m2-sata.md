On-going review of  "Sabrent M.2 SSD [NGFF] to USB 3.0 / SATA III 2.5-Inch Aluminum Enclosure Adapter (EC-M2CU)" [https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07924J5NT/ref=twister_B0895KGSY1?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07924J5NT/ref=twister_B0895KGSY1?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1)
Will update this post as needed. I added link to this blog-post in my original review on amazon (below)

### (Amazon review headline of 2020-06-11) Have 4 & all ok:  no smoke, no overheating (40 typ, max 55 deg C), ssd fits fine. 
I have 4 of the "M.2 to SATA/USB 3.0" bought elsewhere, but was concerned at a lot of 1-star reviews mentioning smoke, overheating, and destroyed SSDs. So I went and used free smartctl/gsmartcontrol software to look at temperature of the SSD, and it is typically 40 degC, with lifetime Min/Max 26/55. That max of 55 degC was probably when cloning the mechanical drive to the SSD, and is not that hot for a SSD. If they get hotter, I'll update my detailed blog-post on this adapter at https://porteusconf.github.io/2020/06/13/sabrent-m2-sata.html site. Note I also had no problems inserting M2. *sata* SSDs as others complained. In short, I have noticed none of the problems mentioned in any of the 1-star reviews. The 4 older Lenovo laptops where I replaced the HD with SSD are all running win10 and are aware it is an SSD, allow doing TRIM, SMART pass through (both in sata and usb3 mode). Even tho laptop is only sata2, speed seems great: Seq R/W= 554/151 MB/s, Random R/W= 137/128 MB/s.  Only in use about a week but so far no complaints.
