# HowTo host a blog on github.
This is my intial (welcome) post, and to give credit where due, everything under the line below starting with "Here's the table of contents" is verbatim from [fastai/fast_template](https://github.com/fastai/fast_template) which is the tool used to create and manage this blog. If you also want to host your own free blog like this one, just go to  https://github.com/fastai/fast_template where at top (to right of "A template for really easy blogging with GitHub Pages") is link to step-by-step instructions at:  [Your own hosted blog, the easy, free, open way (even if you're not a computer expert) Written: 16 Jan 2020 by Jeremy Howard](https://www.fast.ai/2020/01/16/fast_template/) 

So the rest of this file is exact copy of the template provide by fastai) and can be used as a cheat-sheet (quick reference) demonstrating **HowTo** create, write and format blog postings. Just edit (or view this file as raw), you'll see the markup code for each example below. [TODO] For each example below **not** already covered at [markdownguide.org](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/) *(if any)*, add note below and show  ```escaped markup code``` for each such uncovered example.

Here's the table of contents:

## Basic setup

Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format:

`YEAR-MONTH-DAY-filename.md`

Where `YEAR` is a four-digit number, `MONTH` and `DAY` are both two-digit numbers, and `filename` is whatever file name you choose, to remind yourself what this post is about. `.md` is the file extension for markdown files.

The first line of the file should start with a single hash character, then a space, then your title. This is how you create a "*level 1 heading*" in markdown. Then you can create level 2, 3, etc headings as you wish but repeating the hash character, such as you see in the line `## File names` above.

## Basic formatting

You can use *italics*, **bold**, `code font text`, and create [links](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/). Here's a footnote [^1]. Here's a horizontal rule:
