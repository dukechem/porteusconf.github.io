### Covid sites. Hints on using zoom video-conferencing
The [John Hopkins site](https://www.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6) you see everywhere is best place for overview. (It is first hit googling for "github covid"). 

Also hosted on github is [https://covid19dashboards.com/](https://covid19dashboards.com)  Here you can see many breakout graphs so you can tell if the curve is flattening for your Country/Province/State compared to others (with defaults being the top few, currently US, Spain, Italy), or for states, currently NY, WA, GA, LA.

Finally, just a few quick hints to keep zoom fast and safe
* Require password to enter meeting
* Quit any VPN
* UN-check "HD Video" (in settings)
* Mute your microphone whenever you are not speaking! (in settings, choose mute as default)
