### Covid sites. Hints on using zoom video-conferencing

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54XLXg4fYsc is best site I've found to explain "How To Tell If We're Beating COVID-19". And it links to a live-updating [aatishb.com/covidtrends](https://aatishb.com/covidtrends/) where you can look at daily-updated live graphs for your country, province, state, etc.

The [John Hopkins site](https://www.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6) you see everywhere is best place for overview. (It is first hit googling for "github covid"). 

Also hosted on github is [https://covid19dashboards.com/](https://covid19dashboards.com)  Here you can see many breakout graphs so you can tell if the curve is flattening for your Country/Province/State compared to others (with defaults being the top few, currently US, Spain, Italy), or for states, currently NY, WA, GA, LA.
