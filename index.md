A blog of hopefully helpful postings of practical info for everyday computing, with intended audience of computer end-users (mac/win/linux) and maybe even helpdesk folks. Hoping to use tone and style of "dummy" books, so this blog is for the ["copleat idiot" in tribute to John Muir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Muir_(engineer)) book titles: not intended as an insult, but rather just to say I try not to assume anything about the knowledge of the reader, and try to provide procedures, even for complex tasks,  that any "idiot" can follow. ;-)
